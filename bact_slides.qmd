## Our dataset (from Ranjit et al. in prep, Ohio State)

- _Pseudomonas syringae_ causes disease in a wide range of host plants,
  from Solanaceae and Leguminosae plants to citrus and stone fruit trees.

- _Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae_ (Pss) is an emerging phytopathogen that causes
  Pseudomonas leaf spot (PLS) disease in pepper plants (_Capsicum annuum var. annuum_). 
  
Currently, copper-based (copper sulfate or copper hydroxide) or streptomycin-based antimicrobials are used as chemical control methods for Pss in peppers.
However, in recent years, the intensive application of copper-based antimicrobials to reduce PLS during the growing season has resulted in the emergence of copper-resistant strains of Pss, making copper-based antimicrobial agents less effective (8, 14).

- 16 Pss samples were isolated from pepper plants harboring characteristic PLS symptoms
  in Ohio between 2013 and 2021.
