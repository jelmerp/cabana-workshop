_If you're going to use a Unix shell at OSC for your [homework](homework.qmd),_
_make sure to also run the step at the bottom of this page,_
_to copy the data set for the Software Carpentry lession._

<br>

## Open a Unix shell at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)

1.  If you haven't already: **create an OSC account** by following the link in the email you received from OSC.

2.  Go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu> and **log in**.

    Once you are logged in, you should see a landing page similar to the one below:

3.  Click on the **Clusters** dropdown menu in the top blue bar, and then on **Pitzer Shell Access**:

4.  This should open a new browser tab that looks approximately like this:

#### Your screen will be slightly different from the screenshot above:

-   You should see even more "welcome messages" (which is everything except for the last line),
    and some of these are personalized, so they will differ for you.
-   The last line in the screenshot (`jelmer@pitzer-login04 ~]$`) is your shell "**prompt**", which is personalized as well:
    -   You will see your own username (not `jelmer`) before the `@`
    -   You may be on a different "login node" so may e.g. see `@pitzer-login03`

## Copy the Software Carpentry data set

If you opened a shell at OSC to do the [Unix shell homework](homework.qmd),
then please also perform the following step:

-   **Copy and paste the following code in your Unix shell, and then press <kbd>Enter</kbd>:**

``` bash
mkdir Desktop
cp -r /fs/scratch/PAS2250/cabana/homework/shell/shell-lesson-data Desktop/
```

The above code created a folder (directory) called "Desktop" in your home directory,
and copied the Software Carpentry dataset into the new Desktop folder.
Now, you should be able to **skip** everything on the Software Carpentry ["Summary and Setup" page](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/index.html).
