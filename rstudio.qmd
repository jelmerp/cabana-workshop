## Steps to start an RStudio session at OSC

1.  If you haven't already: **create an OSC account** by following the link in the email you received from the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC).

2.  Go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu> and **log in** --- use the simple username + password login on the left.

3.  Click on **`Interactive Apps`** (top bar) and then **`RStudio Server`** (all the way at the bottom)

4.  Fill out the form as follows:

    -   Cluster: **`Pitzer`**
    -   R version: **`4.3.0`**
    -   Project: **`PAS2250`**
    -   Number of hours: **`4`**
    -   Node type: **`any`**
    -   Number of cores: **`2`**

5.  Click the big blue **`Launch`** button at the bottom

6.  Now, you should be sent to a new page with a box at the top for your RStudio Server "job", which should initially be "Queued" (waiting to start).

7.  Your job should start running very soon, with the top bar of the box turning green and saying "Running".

#### Having trouble installing the *tidyverse* package?

If you are using RStudio at OSC for your [homework](homework.qmd),
and the installation of the *tidyverse* package (or another package)
with `install.packages()` fails, please load the packages that the Carpentries lesson uses as follows
(no installation needed):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
custom_library <- "/fs/scratch/PAS2250/ENT6703/share/rlib"
library(tidyverse, lib.loc = custom_library)
library(hexbin, lib.loc = libdir)
library(patchwork, lib.loc = libdir)
library(RSQLite, lib.loc = libdir)
```
