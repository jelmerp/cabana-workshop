#### Having trouble installing the _tidyverse_ package?

If you are using RStudio at OSC and your _tidyverse_ package installation fails,
please load this package as follows (no installation needed):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
custom_library <- "/fs/scratch/PAS2250/ENT6703/share/rlib"
library(withr, lib.loc = custom_library)
library(tidyr, lib.loc = custom_library)
library(tidyverse, lib.loc = custom_library)
```
