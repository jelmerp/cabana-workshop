## A computational infrastructure for genomics

Due in large part to the amount of data involved, a laptop or desktop computer is often
not sufficient to work with large-scale genomics data.

Additionally, many of the specialized programs that help you analyze your data can
only be run through a "command-line interface".

Those are some of the reasons that a typical computational infrastructure to do what
we may call "command-line genomics" involves:

1.  A **supercomputer**[^1] --- in our case, the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) *\[this session\]*
2.  A **text editor** --- I recommend and will demonstrate VS Code *\[[next session](02_vscode.qmd)\]*
3.  The **Unix shell** (terminal) *\[[third session](03_shell.qmd)\]*
4.  **R** (or perhaps Python) for interactive statistical analysis and visualization *\[[this afternoon](05_amplicon.qmd)\]*

[^1]: Cloud computing is an alternative, but won't be covered here.

**This session** will provide an introduction to supercomputers in general and to the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) specifically. In all of today's and tomorrow's sessions at this workshop, we'll continue to work at OSC, so you will get a fair bit of experience with working at a supercomputer.

<br>

## High-performance computing

A **supercomputer** (also known as a "compute cluster" or simply a "**cluster**") consists of many computers that are connected by a high-speed network, and that can be accessed remotely by its users. In more general terms, supercomputers provide high-performance computing (**HPC**) resources.

This is what Owens, one of the OSC supercomputers, physically looks like:

<p align="center">

<img src="img/owens.jpg" width="50%"/>

</p>

Here are some possible reasons to use a supercomputer instead of your own laptop or desktop:

-   Your analyses take a long time to run, need large numbers of CPUs, or a large amount of memory.
-   You need to run some analyses many times.
-   You need to store a lot of data.
-   Your analyses require specialized hardware, such as GPUs.
-   Your analyses require software available only for the Linux operating system, but you use Windows.

When you're working with genomics data, many of these reasons typically apply.
This can make it hard or sometimes simply impossible to do all your work on your personal workstation,
and supercomputers provide a solution.

#### The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)

The Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC) is a facility provided by the state of Ohio in the US. It has two supercomputers, lots of storage space, and an excellent infrastructure for accessing these resources.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
#### OSC websites and "projects" _(Click to expand)_

OSC has **three main websites** --- we will mostly or only use the first:

-   [**https://ondemand.osc.edu**](https://ondemand.osc.edu){.uri}: A web portal to use OSC resources through your browser (*login needed*).
-   <https://my.osc.edu>: Account and project management (*login needed*).
-   <https://osc.edu>: General website with information about the supercomputers, installed software, and usage.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

Access to OSC's computing power and storage space goes through OSC "Projects":

-   A project can be tied to a research project or lab, or be educational like the project `PAS2250` you have been added to.
-   Each project has a budget in terms of "compute hours" and storage space^[But we don't have to pay anthing for educational projects like this one. Otherwise, if you're interested in OSC's rates for academic research, see [this page](https://www.osc.edu/content/academic_fee_model_faq).].
-   As a user, it's possible to be a member of multiple different projects.

## The structure of a supercomputer center

### Terminology

Let's start with some terminology, going from smaller things to bigger things:

-   **Core / Processor / CPU / Thread**\
    Components of a computer (node) that can each (semi-)indendepently be asked to perform a computing task like running a bioinformatics program. For our purposes, we can treat these terms as synonyms.
-   **Node**\
    A single computer that is a part of a supercomputer and has dozens of cores[^2].
-   **Supercomputer / Cluster**\
    A collection of computers connected by a high-speed network. OSC has two: "Pitzer" and "Owens".
-   **Supercomputer Center**\
    A facility like OSC that has one or more supercomputers.

[^2]: I.e., these nodes tend to be more powerful than a personal laptop or desktop

<p align="center">

<img src="img/terminology.png" width="85%"/>

</p>

### Supercomputer components

We can think of a supercomputer as having three main parts:

-   **File Systems**: Where files are stored (these are shared between the two clusters!)
-   **Login Nodes**: The handful of computers everyone shares after logging in
-   **Compute Nodes**: The many computers you can reserve to run your analyses

<p align="center">

<img src="img/cluster_overview_ed.png" width="85%"/>

</p>

Let's take those in order.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### File systems

OSC has several distinct file systems --- we will only see the following two:

| File system | Located within | Quota              | Backed up? | Auto-purged?  | One for each... |
|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| **Home**    | `/users/`      | 500 GB / 1 M files | Yes        | No            | User            |
| **Scratch** | `/fs/scratch/` | 100 TB             | No         | After 90 days | OSC Project     |

In today's and tomorrow's sessions, we will be working in the scratch directory of the OSC Project `PAS2250`: `/fs/scratch/PAS2250`[^3].

[^3]: If you'd be doing research on OSC, though, you would mostly interact with a third kind of file system: the **Project directories**: this is because for most files, you'll want a permanent and backed-up location (i.e., not Scratch or Compute storage), and the Home directory offers relatively limited storage as well as challenges with file sharing.

::: callout-tip
#### Directory is just another word for folder, and written as "dir" for short
:::

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### Login Nodes

Login nodes are set aside as an initial landing spot for everyone who logs in to a supercomputer. There are only a handful of them on each supercomputer, and they are shared among everyone and cannot be "reserved".

As such, login nodes are meant only to do things like organizing your files and creating scripts for compute jobs, and are ***not*** **meant for any serious computing**, which should be done on the compute nodes.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### Compute Nodes

Data processing and analysis is done on compute nodes. You can only use compute nodes after putting in a **request** for resources (a "job"). A *job scheduler*[^4] will then assign resources to your request.

[^4]: OSC uses the Slurm job scheduler

::: callout-note
#### Interactive and batch use of compute nodes

Requests for compute node jobs can be made through the OnDemand website or with commands like `srun` and `sbatch`.

Jobs can either be **interactive** (like running Rstudio or interactive shell jobs)
or be a "**batch**" job (sending a script away to be run on a compute node).
Only with interactive jobs do you "move" to a compute node yourself.
:::

Compute nodes come in different shapes and sizes.
You mostly don't have to worry about this but sometimes non-standard nodes are needed,
such as when you need a lot of RAM memory or need GPUs^[GPUs are e.g. used for Nanopore basecalling].

<br>

## OSC OnDemand

The OSC OnDemand web portal allows you to use a web browser to access OSC resources such as:

-   A **file browser** where you can also create and rename folders and files, etc.
-   A **Unix shell**
-   "**Interactive Apps**": programs such as RStudio, Jupyter, VS Code and QGIS.

{{< fa user-edit >}} **Go to <https://ondemand.osc.edu> and log in** (use the box on the left-hand side)

You should see a landing page similar to the one below:

<p align="center">

<img src="img/ondemand_home.png" width="90%"/>

</p>

We will now go through some of the dropdown menus in the **blue bar along the top**.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### **Files**: File system access

Hovering over the **Files** dropdown menu gives a list of directories that you have access to.
If your account is brand new, and you were added to `PAS2250`, you should only have two directories listed[^6]:

[^6]: If you had been added to another project than `PAS2250`,you would have had at least 3:
`PAS2250` does not have a "project dir", but most projects do.

1.  A **Home** directory (starts with `/users/`)
2.  A project "**scratch**" directory (starts with `/fs/scratch/`) `PAS2250`

{{< fa user-edit >}} **Click on the directory `/fs/scratch/PAS2250`**, where we'll be working today and next week:

![](img/ondemand_files_PAS2250.png){fig-align="center" width="45%"}

Once there, you should see whichever directories and files are present at the selected location
(here: just two dirs, `cabana` and `ENT6703`),
and you can click on the directories to explore the contents further:

![](img/ondemand_files_PAS2250_2.png){fig-align="center" width="95%"}

This interface is **much like the file browser on your own computer**, so you can also create, delete, move and copy files and folders, and even upload (from your computer to OSC) and download (from OSC your computer) files^[Though this is not meant for large (\>1 GB) transfers. Different methods are available for those but are outside the scope of this introduction] --- see the buttons across the top.

[^7]: Cloud computing is an alternative, but won't be covered here.

[^8]: Cloud computing is an alternative, but won't be covered here.

::: exercise
#### {{< fa user-edit >}} **Exercise**: Create your own folder

-   Click your way into `cabana` within `/fs/scratch/PAS2250` if you're not already there.
-   You should see a number of directories, e.g. `homework`, `jelmer` and `mizarra`.
-   Create your own by clicking the `New Directory` button towards the top.
-   Please give it the **exact same name as your OSC username** (also match the capitalization!).

*(If you're not sure what your username is --- look at the right side of the blue top bar, "Logged in as":)*

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### **Clusters**: Unix shell access

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
#### Side note: **System Status** within **Clusters** _(Click to expand)_

In the "**Clusters**" dropdown menu, click on the item at the bottom, "**System Status**":

![](img/ondemand_systemstatus_select.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

This page shows an overview of the live, current usage of the two clusters ---
that can be interesting to get a good idea of the scale of the supercomputer center,
which cluster is being used more,
what the size of the "queue" (which has jobs waiting to start) is, and so on.

![](img/ondemand_systemstatus.png){fig-align="center" width="90%"}
:::

Interacting with a supercomputer is most commonly done using a Unix shell.
Under the **Clusters** dropdown menu, you can access a Unix shell either on Owens or Pitzer:

![](img/ondemand_shell_select.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

I'm selecting a shell on the Pitzer supercomputer ("Pitzer Shell Access"),
which will open a new browser tab, where the bottom of the page looks like this:

![](img/ondemand_shell2.png){fig-align="center" width="95%"}

However, from now on, we'll be accessing a Unix shell **inside the VS Code text editor**, which also gives us some additional functionality in a user-friendly way.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

### Interactive Apps

We can access programs with Graphical User Interfaces (**GUI**s; point-and-click interfaces)
via the **Interactive Apps** dropdown menu --- let's select VS Code using the "Code Server" button:

![](img/ondemand_vscode_select.png){fig-align="center" width="32%"}

Interactive Apps like VS Code and RStudio **run on compute nodes** (not login nodes).
Because compute nodes always need to be "reserved",
we have to fill out a form and specify the following details:

| Option                                                                 | Value                                                                                                         |
|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| The OSC `Project` that should be billed for the compute resource usage | `PAS2250`                                                                                                     |
| The `Number of hours` we want to make a reservation for[^9]            | `10`                                                                                                          |
| The `Working Directory`[^10] for the program                           | your newly-created personal folder in `/fs/scratch/PAS2250/cabana` (e.g. `/fs/scratch/PAS2250/cabana/jelmer`) |
| The `Codeserver Version`                                               | `4.8`                                                                                                         |

[^9]: Note that we'll be kicked off as soon as that amount of time has passed!

[^10]: This will be your starting location in the file system, we'll talk more about working dirs in a little bit.

![](img/ondemand_vscode_form2.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Click on **Launch** at the bottom, which will send your request to the "compute job" scheduler.

First, your job will be "*Queued*" — that is, waiting for the job scheduler to allocate compute node resources to it:

![](img/ondemand_vscode_queued.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

Your job is typically granted resources within a few seconds (the card will then say "*Starting*"),
and should be ready for usage ("*Running*") in another couple of seconds:

![](img/ondemand_vscode_running.png){fig-align="center" width="75%"}

Once it appears, click on the blue **Connect to VS Code** button to open VS Code in a new browser tab.

When VS Code opens, you may get these two pop-ups (and possibly some others) ---
click "Yes" (and check the box) and "Don't Show Again", respectively:

#### What works differently on a supercomputer like at OSC?

Compared to command-line computing on a laptop or desktop, the following aspects are different when working on a supercomputer like at OSC:

-   **Login versus compute nodes**\
    "Login nodes", the nodes you end up on after logging in, are not meant for heavy computing and you have to *request access to "compute nodes"* to run most analyses.
-   **"Non-interactive" computing is common**\
    It is common to write and "submit" scripts to a queue instead of running programs interactively.
-   **Software**\
    You generally can't install "the regular way", and a lot of installed software needs to be "loaded" (as we'll see today).
-   **Operating system**\
    Supercomputers run on the Linux operating system
