## What is VS Code?

VS Code is basically a **fancy text editor**. Its full name is Visual Studio Code, but at OSC, it is also referred to as "Code Server".

To emphasize the additional functionality relative to basic text editors like Notepad and TextEdit, editors like VS Code are also referred to as "**IDEs**": *Integrated Development Environments*. The RStudio program is another good example of an IDE. For our purposes:

-   VS code will be our IDE for Unix shell code
-   RStudio will be our IDE for R

## Connecting to VS Code

We saw on the previous page ([link](01_osc.html#interactive-apps)) how to start a VS Code session at OSC, and you should have one active now.

##### Starting VS Code at OSC - Instructions in brief *(Click to expand)*

1.  Log in to OSC's OnDemand portal at <https://ondemand.osc.edu>.
2.  In the blue top bar, select `Interactive Apps` and then near the bottom of the dropdown menu, click `Code Server`.
3.  In the form that appears on a new page:
    -   Select OSC project `PAS2250`
    -   The starting directory: `/fs/scratch/PAS2250/cabana/<your_personal_dir>`
    -   `Number of hours`: `10`
    -   Click `Launch`.
4.  On the next page, once the top bar of the box has turned green and says `Runnning`, 
    click **`Connect to VS Code`**.

## The VS Code User Interface

![](img/vscode-welcome_ed.png){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

#### Side bars

The **Activity Bar** (narrow side bar) on the far left has:

-   A {{< fa bars >}} ("hamburger menu"), which has menu items like `File` that you often find in a top bar.
-   A {{< fa cog >}} (cog wheel icon) in the bottom, through which you can mainly access *settings*.
-   Icons to toggle **(wide) Side Bar** options --- but we'll only use the default selection, the *Explorer* (file browser)

#### Editor pane and `Welcome` document

The main part of the VS Code is the **editor pane**. Here, we can open files like scripts and other types of text files, and images. (Whenever you open VS Code, an editor tab with a `Welcome` document is automatically opened. This provides some help and some shortcuts like to recently opened files and folders.)

#### Terminal (with a Unix shell)

{{< fa user-edit >}} **Open a terminal** by clicking   {{< fa bars >}}   =\> `Terminal` =\> `New Terminal`.

<hr style="height:1pt; visibility:hidden;" />

#### {{< fa user-edit >}} Exercise: Try a few color themes

1.  Access the "Color Themes" option by clicking <i class="fa fa-cog"></i> =\> `Color Theme`.
2.  Try out a few themes and see pick one you like!

## A folder as a starting point

Conveniently, VS Code takes a specific directory as a **starting point in all parts of the program**:

-   In the file explorer in the side bar
-   In the terminal
-   When saving files in the editor pane.

_(If you need to switch folders, click   {{< fa bars >}}   =\>   `File`   =\>   `Open Folder`.)_

#### Some VS Code tips and tricks

-   **Resizing panes**\
    You can resize panes (the terminal, editor, and side bar) by hovering your cursor over the borders and then dragging.

-   **The Command Palette**\
    To access all the menu options that are available in VS Code, the so-called "Command Palette" can be handy, especially if you know what you are looking for. To access the Command Palette, click   <i class="fa fa-cog"></i>   and then `Command Palette` (or press <kbd>F1</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>).

-   **Keyboard shortcuts**\
    For a single-page PDF overview of keyboard shortcuts for your operating system:   {{< fa bars >}}   =\>   `Help`   =\>   `Keyboard Shortcut Reference`. (Or for direct links to these PDFs: [Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf) / [Mac](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-macos.pdf) / [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-linux.pdf).) A couple of useful keyboard shortcuts are highlighted below.

#### Specific useful keyboard shortcuts *(Click to expand)*

Working with keyboard shortcuts for common operations can be a lot faster than using your mouse. Below are some useful ones for VS Code (for Mac, in some case, you'll have to replace <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>⌘</kbd>):

-   *Open a terminal*: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> (backtick) or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>.

-   *Toggle between the terminal and the editor pane*: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>\`</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>.

-   *Toggle the (wide) Side Bar*: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd>

-   *Line actions*:

    -   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> / <kbd>C</kbd> will **cut/copy the entire line** where the cursor is, when nothing is selected (!)

    -   <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> will **delete a line**

    -   <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>⬆</kbd>/<kbd>⬇</kbd> will **move lines** up or down.
