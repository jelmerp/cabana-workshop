**If you have very limited or no experience with R and/or the Unix shell**[^1], please go through the following homework before you need these skills in the workshop on Wednesday.

[^1]: The Unix shell is also known as the "terminal" or "command line".

*If you do have some experience with R and the Unix shell*, we would suggest that you at least take a look at the material below, to check that you are familiar with most or all of its contents.

## R

Please work your way through the Data Carpentry "XX" lesson...

<br>

## Unix Shell

Please work your way through the [Software Carpentry "Shell Novice" lesson](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) up until and including at least episode 3 ("Working With Files and Directories").

You can optionally make your way through the remaining episodes, but that content will in part be taught in the workshop itself, and in part not be used at all.

#### Using Windows?

If your computer uses the Windows operating system, you will not have a Unix shell installed by default[^2]. To go through the lesson above, you have two options:

1.  **Install a Unix shell**\
    Follow the instructions in the Software Carpentry lesson that I linked to above (and here is a direct link to the [installation instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/install_instructions/#shell)). If this fails for you, please use the next option instead.

2.  **Use a Unix shell at the Ohio Supercomputer Center (OSC)**\
    Follow [these instructions elsewhere on this website](open_shell.qmd).
:::

[^2]: If you have a Mac or Linux computer, you *should* have a Unix shell installed.
